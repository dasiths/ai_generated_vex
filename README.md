# Security Vulnerability Assessment with VEX Generation

**VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)** tells you whether vulnerabilities actually matter in your specific environment. Instead of just listing CVEs, VEX provides context about real exploitability.

## The Problem with Traditional Vulnerability Scanning

Traditional vulnerability scanners generate overwhelming noise - reporting every CVE found in dependencies without considering whether they're actually exploitable. Security teams waste critical time triaging hundreds of theoretical vulnerabilities while real threats go unaddressed.

**Common Issues:**
- **False Positives**: Vulnerable libraries that aren't actually reachable by attackers
- **Context Blindness**: Scanners can't evaluate runtime protections, network controls, or application-specific mitigations
- **Alert Fatigue**: Teams become desensitized to constant vulnerability reports
- **Resource Misallocation**: Critical effort spent on non-exploitable CVEs instead of real security gaps

## Why Exploitability Analysis Matters

This workflow addresses fundamental gaps in traditional security assessment by focusing on **actual risk** rather than theoretical vulnerability presence. The exploitability analysis phase performs deep technical investigation that answers the critical question: "Can an attacker actually exploit this in our specific environment?"

**Technical Depth Required:**
- **Code Reachability Analysis**: Tracing execution paths from entry points to vulnerable functions
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Identifying realistic attack vectors and prerequisites
- **Environmental Context**: Evaluating protective controls, deployment configurations, and runtime defenses
- **Exploitation Feasibility**: Assessing real-world conditions needed for successful attacks

**Beyond CVE Catalogs:**
While CVE databases document known vulnerabilities, they can't evaluate your specific implementation context. A CVE marked "Critical" may be completely unexploitable due to how your application is architected, deployed, or protected. Conversely, application-specific vulnerabilities not captured in any CVE database may pose significant risk.

**Supply Chain Transparency:**
VEX documents provide standardized communication about vulnerability status across development teams, security organizations, and third-party vendors. Instead of blanket vulnerability reports, stakeholders receive evidence-based determinations about actual risk exposure.

## What You Get

This automated workflow generates three comprehensive security deliverables:

1. **üìÑ Summary** - Executive overview of critical findings
2. **üìã Security Report** - Detailed technical analysis with remediation guidance
3. **üîí VEX Document** - Industry-standard OpenVEX-compliant exploitability determinations generated using the VEX Document MCP Server

**üìÅ Example Reports**: [docs/security/reports/](docs/security/reports/) | **üìñ Full Instructions**: [.github/instructions/vex.instructions.md](.github/instructions/vex.instructions.md)

## How It Works

**4-Step Automated Workflow:**

### 1. üîç Comprehensive Scanning
Trivy MCP identifies CVEs, misconfigurations, secrets, and license issues across dependencies and infrastructure.

### 2. üß† Exploitability Analysis *(Critical Step)*
The most important phase - rigorous technical analysis determining whether each CVE is actually exploitable:
- **Code Path Tracing**: Map complete execution flows from entry points to vulnerable code
- **Attack Prerequisites**: Evaluate authentication, network access, and input validation barriers
- **Environmental Protections**: Assess runtime defenses, deployment controls, and monitoring capabilities
- **Evidence Collection**: Document concrete technical proof for every exploitability determination

### 3. üîí OWASP Top 10 Review
Systematic manual review discovering application-specific vulnerabilities beyond known CVEs:
- Business logic flaws not captured in vulnerability databases
- Implementation-specific security issues
- Configuration and deployment vulnerabilities
- Custom code security patterns

### 4. üìã Comprehensive Documentation
Generate three industry-standard deliverables with complete technical analysis and evidence-based conclusions. VEX documents are created using the VEX Document MCP Server to ensure OpenVEX compliance and standardized vulnerability communication.

## Quick Start

### 1. Provide Required Information
GitHub Copilot will ask for three details before starting:
- **Report Name**: `my-app-security-assessment`
- **Product Name**: `my-application`
- **Scope**: `src/` (directories to analyze)

### 2. Start Assessment
```
Perform a security assessment and generate VEX documentation.

Report Name: my-app-assessment
Product: my-application
Scope: src/
```

### 3. Get Results
All deliverables automatically saved to: `docs/security/reports/[report-name]/`

**That's it!** Copilot handles the complex 4-step analysis workflow automatically.

**‚ö° Automation with Intelligence**: Combines automated scanning tools with human-level security analysis reasoning

## Setup

### Development Container (Recommended)

This project uses a **development container** that automatically sets up all required tools and dependencies:

**Pre-installed Tools:**

- **Trivy** (v0.63.0) - Vulnerability scanner with MCP plugin
- **Go** (v1.24.4) - For vexctl installation
- **Node.js** (v22) - For vexdoc-mcp installation
- **Docker** - Container runtime for OSV MCP server
- **Python** (3.11) - Base development environment

**Automated Setup:**

1. Clone repository: `git clone <repository> && cd ai_generated_vex`
2. Open in VS Code with Dev Containers extension
3. Select "Reopen in Container" when prompted
4. All tools install automatically via [`.devcontainer/post_create.sh`](.devcontainer/post_create.sh)

**What Gets Installed Automatically:**

- Trivy MCP plugin
- vexctl CLI tool
- vexdoc-mcp NPM package
- Git submodules (OSV MCP server)

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If not using the dev container, you'll need to install the following prerequisites first:

**Prerequisites Required:**

- **Docker** - For running the OSV MCP server
- **Go** (v1.24+ recommended) - For vexctl installation
- **Node.js** (v22+ recommended) - For vexdoc-mcp installation  
- **Git** - For repository management and submodules
- **Trivy** (v0.63.0+ recommended) - Security scanner

**Manual Installation Steps:**

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd ai_generated_vex

# Option 1: Use automated setup (requires prerequisites above)
make setup

# Option 2: Manual step-by-step installation
git submodule init && git submodule update
trivy plugin install mcp
go install github.com/openvex/vexctl@v0.3.0
npm install -g https://github.com/rosstaco/vexdoc-mcp/releases/download/0.0.1-pre-release/vexdoc-mcp-0.0.1.tgz

# Start OSV MCP server
make start-osv-mcp-server
```

**Note**: The development container automatically installs and configures all these prerequisites with the exact versions tested for this project.

### Available Makefile Commands

The project includes helpful makefile targets for development:

```bash
make help                  # Show all available commands
make setup                 # Install all required tools and dependencies
make start-osv-mcp-server  # Start the OSV MCP server
make stop-osv-mcp-server   # Stop the OSV MCP server
make status-osv-mcp-server # Check OSV MCP server status
make logs-osv-mcp-server   # View OSV MCP server logs
```

### MCP Configuration for GitHub Copilot
