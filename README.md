# Security Vulnerability Assessment with VEX Generation

**VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)** tells you whether vulnerabilities actually matter in your specific environment. Instead of just listing CVEs, VEX provides context about real exploitability.

## The Problem with Traditional Vulnerability Scanning

Traditional vulnerability scanners generate overwhelming noise - reporting every CVE found in dependencies without considering whether they're actually exploitable. Security teams waste critical time triaging hundreds of theoretical vulnerabilities while real threats go unaddressed.

**Common Issues:**
- **False Positives**: Vulnerable libraries that aren't actually reachable by attackers
- **Context Blindness**: Scanners can't evaluate runtime protections, network controls, or application-specific mitigations
- **Alert Fatigue**: Teams become desensitized to constant vulnerability reports
- **Resource Misallocation**: Critical effort spent on non-exploitable CVEs instead of real security gaps

## Why Exploitability Analysis Matters

This workflow addresses fundamental gaps in traditional security assessment by focusing on **actual risk** rather than theoretical vulnerability presence. The exploitability analysis phase performs deep technical investigation that answers the critical question: "Can an attacker actually exploit this in our specific environment?"

**Technical Depth Required:**
- **Code Reachability Analysis**: Tracing execution paths from entry points to vulnerable functions
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Identifying realistic attack vectors and prerequisites
- **Environmental Context**: Evaluating protective controls, deployment configurations, and runtime defenses
- **Exploitation Feasibility**: Assessing real-world conditions needed for successful attacks

**Beyond CVE Catalogs:**
While CVE databases document known vulnerabilities, they can't evaluate your specific implementation context. A CVE marked "Critical" may be completely unexploitable due to how your application is architected, deployed, or protected. Conversely, application-specific vulnerabilities not captured in any CVE database may pose significant risk.

**Supply Chain Transparency:**
VEX documents provide standardized communication about vulnerability status across development teams, security organizations, and third-party vendors. Instead of blanket vulnerability reports, stakeholders receive evidence-based determinations about actual risk exposure.

## What You Get

This automated workflow generates three comprehensive security deliverables:

1. **üìÑ Summary** - Executive overview of critical findings
2. **üìã Security Report** - Detailed technical analysis with remediation guidance
3. **üîí VEX Document** - Industry-standard OpenVEX-compliant exploitability determinations generated using the VEX Document MCP Server

**üìÅ Example Reports**: [docs/security/reports/](docs/security/reports/) | **üìñ Full Instructions**: [.github/instructions/vex.instructions.md](.github/instructions/vex.instructions.md)

## How It Works

**4-Step Automated Workflow:**

### 1. üîç Comprehensive Scanning
Trivy MCP identifies CVEs, misconfigurations, secrets, and license issues across dependencies and infrastructure.

### 2. üß† Exploitability Analysis *(Critical Step)*
The most important phase - rigorous technical analysis determining whether each CVE is actually exploitable:
- **Code Path Tracing**: Map complete execution flows from entry points to vulnerable code
- **Attack Prerequisites**: Evaluate authentication, network access, and input validation barriers
- **Environmental Protections**: Assess runtime defenses, deployment controls, and monitoring capabilities
- **Evidence Collection**: Document concrete technical proof for every exploitability determination

### 3. üîí OWASP Top 10 Review
Systematic manual review discovering application-specific vulnerabilities beyond known CVEs:
- Business logic flaws not captured in vulnerability databases
- Implementation-specific security issues
- Configuration and deployment vulnerabilities
- Custom code security patterns

### 4. üìã Comprehensive Documentation
Generate three industry-standard deliverables with complete technical analysis and evidence-based conclusions. VEX documents are created using the VEX Document MCP Server to ensure OpenVEX compliance and standardized vulnerability communication.

## Quick Start

### 1. Provide Required Information
GitHub Copilot will ask for three details before starting:
- **Report Name**: `my-app-security-assessment`
- **Product Name**: `my-application`
- **Scope**: `src/` (directories to analyze)

### 2. Start Assessment
```
Perform a security assessment and generate VEX documentation.

Report Name: my-app-assessment
Product: my-application
Scope: src/
```

### 3. Get Results
All deliverables automatically saved to: `docs/security/reports/[report-name]/`

**That's it!** Copilot handles the complex 4-step analysis workflow automatically.

## CVE Exploit Analysis Workflow

For a more detailed CVE exploit analysis beyond standard VEX generation, this project includes a specialized **CVE Exploit Analysis Workflow** that transforms security report findings into a detailed analysys of the CVE.

### üéØ Purpose

Analyze existing security reports to create detailed exploit scenarios and proof-of-concept demonstrations for CVE vulnerabilities. This workflow transforms CVE findings into actionable security intelligence for penetration testing and risk assessment.

### üîÑ How It Works

**Iterative CVE Processing**: Analyzes ALL CVEs from security reports one-by-one, clearing context between each to prevent memory overflow while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

**7-Step Process:**

1. **CVE Report Analysis**: Extract and prioritize ALL CVEs from existing security reports
2. **Intelligence Gathering**: Deep research using OCV-MCP tools (OSV, GHSA, exploit databases)
3. **Library Integration Analysis**: Trace how vulnerable libraries are used in application context
4. **Exploit Development**: Create theoretical proof-of-concept demonstrations (documentation only)
5. **Individual CVE Documentation**: Generate detailed exploit analysis per CVE
6. **Progress Tracking**: Manage analysis queue and context clearing
7. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview after processing multiple CVEs

- **ü§ñ Prompt**: [.github/prompts/exploit.prompt.md](.github/prompts/exploit.prompt.md)

### üöÄ Usage

Start the exploit analysis workflow in GitHub Copilot:

```markdown
I want to do a security report exploit analysis for all the CVE's in the latest report.
```

**Requirements:**

- Existing security report with CVE findings (from VEX generation workflow)
- OCV-MCP server running for vulnerability intelligence
- Access to application source code for library integration analysis

### üìä Deliverables

- **Individual CVE Documents**: `[CVE-ID]-exploit-analysis.md` per vulnerability
- **Executive Summary**: `executive-summary-exploit-analysis.md` with business impact
- **Prioritized Findings**: Risk-based ordering of exploitable vs non-exploitable CVEs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Analysis Only**: Creates documentation and theoretical demonstrations - NO actual exploit files
- **CVE Focus**: Only analyzes vulnerabilities with CVE identifiers (excludes OWASP findings)
- **Context Management**: Processes one CVE at a time to maintain analysis quality
- **Memory Safe**: Designed to handle any number of CVEs without context overflow

### üîó Integration

This workflow complements the main VEX generation process by providing deeper technical analysis of specific CVE vulnerabilities identified during security assessment.
