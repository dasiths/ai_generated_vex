The vulnerable code is reachable through standard IdentityServer authentication flows that use GetAuthorizationContextAsync and IsValidReturnUrl methods. The application uses default IdentityServer configuration with no custom URL validation, making the vulnerability exploitable. Attackers can craft malicious URLs that IdentityServer incorrectly treats as local, enabling phishing attacks to steal user credentials after legitimate authentication."
